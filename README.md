# Project Mid-term Reflection

--Halloween/Horror Vr Game Demo--

[Overview]

The setting of my project was based in a winter forest. The goal of the demo was to collect a sword after finding all magic items, placing them into crest sockets which then opens the door in a hut where the sword itself is collected, but you got to watch out, a scary skelaton is after you!
